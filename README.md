# fussy
The fussy scripting language implements an algorithm for automatic propagation of random measurement errors in an arbitrary mathematical expression. It is internally implemented as a virtual machine for efficient runtime performance and can be used as an interpreter by the user. A simple C binding to the interpreter is also provided. Mathematical expressions can be implemented as a collection of sub-expressions, as sub-program units (functions or procedures) or as single atomic expressions. Sub-expressions can be assigned to temporary variables which can then be used to write the final expression.  The scripting syntax of fussy is similar to that of C. It is therefore easy to use with minimal learning.  If you find the software useful, we look forward to hearing from you with your comments/suggestions.
